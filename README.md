## FAQ

#### What is SFSD
- Sfsd is A File Structure Module , Designing efficient algorithms for handling large volumes of data on external memory requires a deep understanding of the issues related to input / output operations. This course addresses this problem by presenting the different structures and organization of data (in secondary and primary memory) as well as the study of the associated algorithms including their complexity and efficiency. it being tought in Algeries

#### do We Really Need Sfsd ?
 - Sfsd is really a powerfull modules that gives you the basics of data strucutres by design a simple data set using only blocs , index table, hashing ect
